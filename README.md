VCF 3 contact Importer
============
This was a simple/quick app i made after i upgraded my mobile from Nokia N900 to Nexus 5. My nokia exported all its contacts in VCF v3 format and i wanted a way to import them all(including contact pics) in my new shiny nexus. Tried a few apps on play store then decided to write my own (Yup,the first thing i did on my Nexus was to enable the Developer option ;) ).

All credit goes to mike.angstadt for making the awesome VCF parser, ez-vcard [https://code.google.com/p/ez-vcard/], and was able to finish real quick.
